<p style="text-align:center"> Do you think you are going No Where in Life?</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Take a deep breathe</p>
<p style="text-align:center">THINK!</p>
<p style="text-align:center">New York is threehours ahead of California, but that does not make California slow</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Cameroon is six hours ahead of New York but it does not make New York slow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Someone graduated from college at 22 but waited five years before securing a job.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Someone became a CEO at 25 but died at 50.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Someone became a CEO at 50 but lived to 90 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Someone is still single,</p>
<p style="text-align:center">While another is married with children</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Absolutely, everyone in this world works based on their own time zone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">People around you might seem to be ahead of you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">That’s total fine. Some are behind you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Everyone is running their own race in their own time zone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Don’t envy or mock them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">They are in their own time zone and you are in yours.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Life is about waiting for the right moment to react.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">So RELAX.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">You’re not late</p>
<p style="text-align:center">You’re not early</p>
<p style="text-align:center">You’re very much on time, and in your time zone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Everyone have a different exams paper meaning different questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Everyone have a different assignment meaning different purpose in life.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">So focus on your own exampaper, your assignment and purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Don’t copy and paste or steal answer else you will fail big time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Your dreams and visions are all valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Just take your time and do the best you can.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Be like the hummingbird.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Even when mighty lions and tigers underestimated him, he continued to do what he could, where he was ,just as he was, with the little he had.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">You’re ok just the way you are.The little work you are doing today might seem insignificant but I bet someday you will see the big picture.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">You’re Not late ! You’re Not early!</p>
